            <h5>The Problem</h5>
          <P>The <span class="bold">Financial Futures</span> Program is a resource available to low - moderate income Vermonters. The program provides
            a range of capacity building services.  Participants receive an incentive stipend for accomplishing incremental <span class="bold">milestones</span>
            in the program. Unfortunately many participants were routinely missing out on these benefits. We proposed a free mobile app to address some of the issues.</P>

          <P><span class="orange">Constraints:</span> The only information the app can access, is a daily .csv file from the program’s Outcome Tracker system. The app would have no
            capability to edit or amend the information in Outcome Tracker. Delivering value within these constraints was my challenge for this project.</p>

            <P><span class="bold">The Ask:</span></p>
              <ol class="body_list">
                 <li class="numbered">Help participants stay in the program, and more effectively reach program milestones and goals.</span></li>
               <li class="numbered">Come up with a design that creates maximum value within these limited constraints.</span></li>

                       <h5>Design Reviews</h5>
                          <P>    Before finalizing designs, I conducted a round of <span class="bold">reviews</span> with
                          stakeholders, engineering and product management. This led to a few more alterations:
                       <ul class="a">
                         <li>Engineering didn’t believe we could populate the <span class="bold">“coming up”</span>  card.
                           So, we needed to remove that for now.</li>
                          <LI>The client wanted to use the Financial Futures logo.</li>
                        <LI>The client wanted a way for participants to get <span class="orange">reminders. </span>
                          So we made an option for the user to set and control scheduling
                          reminders, independent of the outcome tracker. </li>
                        <li>  Users could also mark a goal complete, in order to <span class="bold">pause</span>  the reminder,
                          even if it didn’t interact with the actual tracker.</li>
