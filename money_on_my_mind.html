           <h5>summary</h5>
         <P><span class="bold">Money on my Mind</span> is a mobile app for use on iOS and Android created by a team of Code4btv volunteers.
            Code4btv is a local brigade of the national Code4America organization, located in Burlington, Vermont.
            The app was created in partnership with The Champlain Valley Office of Economic Opportunity to be used
            by participants in their ReachUp/Financial Futures program.</P>

          <div id="char">
            <h5>The Problem</h5>
          <P>The <span class="bold">Fnancial Futures</span> Program is a resource available to low to moderate income Vermonters through The Champlain
            Valley Office of Economic Opportunity or CVOEO. The program provides a range of capacity building services, such as workshops,
             coaching, matched savings, business development and more to its participants.  Participants receive monetary incentives
              for accomplishing incremental milestones in the program.</P>

          <P>This project involved the design and development of a <span class="bold">mobile app</span> to help participants complete the program and more
            effectively reach program milestones and goals. It was suggested that the app should be somewhat “playful” and “fun.”
            The only information the app can access however, is a daily .csv file from the program’s Outcome Tracker system and the
            app will have no capacity to edit or amend the information in Outcome Tracker.</p>

          <P>So, we needed to come up with a design that created maximum value within these constraints.</p>

        <!--solution -->
        <section class="row3">
           <div id="char">
             <h5>The Solution</h5>
           <P>As we can only “report” information and not actually interact with the program, my approach was part educational roadmap and part financial
             reporting. </p>

             <p>We include push notifications as reminders about goals that are currently in progress and throw an animated “party” when
             goals have been achieved.</p>

             <P> Goals can be “submitted” and rendered “pending approval” in order to pause push notifications and
             re-prioritize the goal list.  Goals can only be marked complete by coaches in the outcome tracker app, so they to the
             “completed” section when this has been registered in the .csv file.</P>

              <h5>user research</h5>
            <P>The first step in my research process was to learn as much about the program as possible. This included reading all
              of the printed and marketing materials.</P>

            <P>I also interviewed coaches in the program and asked them to demonstrate their process for inputting participant
              goals into the Outcome Tracker software. I took screenshots of every step in their process to see what information
              they track.</p>

          <section class="row8">
             <div id="char">
                 <h5>Competitive analysis</h5>
                 <P>Though there would be no actual competitors for this app, as it was being custom built to serve a specific program, I chose to
                   survey many educational, credit reporting and banking apps to see their information architecture and data visualization.</p>
                   <P>The purpose of my research was thus not intended to find opportunities and threats, but to evaluate what seemed to
                   work well in terms of User Flow and Information Architecture.</p>

                   <P>Two apps that I turned to for more in-depth scrutiny were Experian (for credit reporting) and Bloc.io (for educational roadmap)
                     inspiration. </p>


                 <P><span class="bold">Results of my analysis:</span></p>
                 <P><span class="bold">Experian:</span> Experian seemed to present a “snippet” of all relevant information, on the front dashboard in a
                   linear sequence. The possibility to see more from each section was readily available, but the short blurb seemed very helpful for
                   creating an initial snapshot or scan of the landscape. There was also a nice graphical representation of the all important “score”
                   right at the top of the list.</p>
                 <P><span class="bold">Bloc.io:</span> is an online program in Web Development and UX Design. As a participant in the program, I was familiar
                   with ther interface and how it represented position in an educational roadmap.  I wanted to evaluate how I could
                   leverage a similar structure to help participants in the financial futures program track their progress and position.</p>

              <p><Span class="bold">Motivations -</span></p>
              <p>He loves to cook, but doesn’t have a lot of free time for shopping and meal planning. He used to belong to a
                CSA and loved the locally sourced, fresh produce. He is very organized and likes to plan ahead.</p>
              <p><Span class="bold">Frustrations -</span></p>
              <p>When he belonged to the CSA, he never knew what he was going to get and so never had the right ingredients
                to pair with what he got in his box. His kids could be picky eaters and he felt without proper planning much
                of the food went to waste.</p>

               <p><Span class="bold">Motivations -</span></p>
               <p>Healthy eating and sustainable living are both a huge priority for Katelyn. Though she would like for
                 everything she consumes to be organic, she needs to be very budget conscious in shopping for food. She
                 would like to shop locally.</p>
               <p><Span class="bold">Frustrations -</span></p>
               <p>CSA options in her area are too expensive for her budget. The shares usually involve too much food.
                 She hates all of the plastic packaging in the supermarket.</p>

               <p><Span class="bold">Motivations -</span></p>
               <p>Kristin really needs things to be convenient and quick because she doesn’t have a lot of time after work. She
                  wants her whole family to eat healthier but finds it hard to implement.</p>
              <p><Span class="bold">Frustrations -</span></p>
              <p>She hates that the only time she has to shop is on the weekend when the stores are busier and prices are higher.
                Eating healthy just seems like so much work. She grew up on processed food and doesn’t really know how to make
                vegetables taste good. She has three picky kids.</p>

                     <P>Using printouts of my wireframes, I conducted a series of early usability tests on my wireframes.
                       These tests suggested I implement a few subtle changes moving forward;

                      <P> After creating a series of mind maps and word lists I settled on the name <Span class="bold">farmbox</span>.</p>
                      <P> Seeing as there is so little awareness of what a CSA is, I wanted a name that was indicative and
                        straightforward- not too abstract. Farmbox is just that. It is a short, straightforward
                        way to describe what you get with a CSA membership.</p>
                        <P> The aesthetic direction for this app was driven by the target customer archetype in a modern, farmer's market loving,
                          eco-conscious foodie.</p>
                        <P>&nbsp;</br>With the name settled and good sense of the “feel”, I moved on to sketching for a logo:</p>

                    <p>I conducted a number of preference tests on logo variations and typography choices which led me to the final,

                      <P>My style guide details all design choices including typography, color palettes and iconography.
                        Again, the basis of the design was to signify a fresh, urban take on rustic authenticity.</p>
                     <P class="dotted"><span class="bold">Color</span></P>
                      <P>For colors I wanted to avoid using green or brown as primary colors.
                        I wanted something striking and unexpected, yet fresh and modern. I
                        chose a palette of deep blue, magenta and pale grey.

                      <P>&nbsp; </br> I used three complimentary fonts.</p>
                      <P>Gothic A1 is used for almost all the body text, navigation and headings. Its a versatile font
                        with many weight options. Burford Rustic is used for the logo and page title. The Girl Next Door is used for landing page headings.

                        <P> In order to offset the amount of text, I also created a series of icons to help my user easily identify

                                 <p>Using usabilityhub.com and slack, I conducted a series of preference tests on my early mock-ups.</p>
                                <P class="dotted"><span class="bold">Test #1</span></p>

                           <p><span class="bold">Result:</span> The most popular choice was A, the closest to my original mock-up.
                             Users liked the richness of the colors and the vegatable variety.</p>

                           <P class="dotted"><span class="bold">Test #2</span></p>
                           <p>This question arose while testing my wireframes- would users prefer drop-downs or scrolling for the sign-up screen.?
                           <img src="images/FB_test_2.png" class=img_c alt="drop down vs scroll test"></p>
                           <p><span class="bold">Result:</span> Preference testing and design reviews indicated that though a lot of
                              scrolling is not ideal, users would rather scroll than
                             have to click on a drop-down and then click a second time to make a selection. Also immediate
                             visibility of all options seemed preferable. So, A. was the clear preference for these tests.</p>

                         <li>Make the active state more than just a different color- bold, underline…</li>
                         <li>Refine buttons for “add to meals” and “add to shopping”</li>
                         <li>create an intermediary pop-up for deciding which meal the add to button leads to</li>
