         <P><span class="highlight">Community Supported Agriculture</span>, or CSA,  is a system that connects the producer and consumers within the
           food system more closely by allowing the consumer to subscribe to the harvest of a certain farm or group of farms.</p>

<P>Farmbox is a simple-to-use mobile app that allows consumers to easily locate, evaluate and sign up for CSA options near
   to a specified location, while also encouraging retention after joining.</P>

            <h5>The Problem</h5>
          <P>Not only is there very  <span class="bold">little awareness</span> about CSA’s in the general population,
            but even for people who are aware, there are very <span class="bold">few centralized resources</span>
            of information about ALL the CSA options available in a particular area.</P>
          <P>Further, there are many common frustrations that CSA users indicate are a barrier to retention, frustrations
             that could potentially be alleviated through the use of an app.</p>
          <P>The main frustration reported by current and former CSA members is simply <span class="bold">not knowing
             what they will be receiving</span>
             each week and what to do with it.</p>

                 <P><span class="highlight">The goal:</span> encourage participation and retention in CSA programs!</p>
           <P>My solution was to create a mobile app that helps users <span class="bold">locate,</span>  evaluate and sign-upfor a CSA  in their area.</p>
           <P>Once signed up, users can easily view subscription <span class="bold">contents</span> for a particular week.</P>
           <P>They also receive <span class="bold">recipe</span> suggestions for the items in their box and can create and save meal plans and

                 <h5>Competitive analysis</h5>
                 <P>Surveying the landscape for competitors, it was challenging to find a true competitor. Three applications emerged that offered some
                   similar functionalities. These applciations were CSAware, Farmigo and Harvie.</p>
                 <BR>&nbsp;<img src="images/competitors_farmbox.png" class=img_b alt="csaware farmigo and harvie logos">
                 <P><span class="bold">Results of my analysis:</span></p>
                 <P><span class="bold">CSAware:</span> is a product for overall farm management that incorporates an app for customers as part of its
                   package. It is a robust package that is aimed at farms rather than consumers, doesn’t offer a centralized locator for all CSA’s and
                    might be expensive and overkill for a small farm.</p>
                 <P><span class="bold">Farmigo:</span> like CSAware, is aimed at farms rather than consumers and is a robust farm management tool. It is
                    not for locating and comparing CSA options and is integrated with farm management software.</p>
                 <P><span class="bold">Harvie:</span> is also aimed at farms, but has a more streamlined interface than the other two competitors and doesn’t
                   seem to involve a whole farm management solution. It does however only represent farms that are signed up with Harvie, rather than
                   fully representing all options in the area.</P>

              <p>He loves to cook, but doesn’t have a lot of free time for shopping and meal planning. He used to belong to a
                CSA and loved the locally sourced, fresh produce. He is very    <span class="highlight">organized</span> and likes to plan ahead.</p>
              <p><Span class="bold">Frustrations -</span></p>
              <p>When he belonged to the CSA, he never knew what he was going to get and so never had the right ingredients
                to pair with what he got in his box. His kids could be picky eaters and he felt that without <span class="highlight">proper planning</span> much
                of the food went to waste.</p>

               <p>Healthy eating and  <span class="highlight">sustainable living</span>] are both a huge priority for Katelyn. Though she would like for
                 everything she consumes to be organic, she needs to be very budget conscious in shopping for food. She
                 would like to shop locally.</p>
               <p><Span class="bold">Frustrations -</span></p>
               <p>CSA options in her area are too expensive for her budget. The shares usually involve <span class="highlight">too much</span> food.
                 She hates all of the plastic packaging in the supermarket.</p>

               <p>Kristin really needs things to be  <span class="highlight">convenient</span> and quick because she doesn’t have a lot of time after work. She
                  wants her whole family to eat healthier but finds it hard to implement.</p>
              <p><Span class="bold">Frustrations -</span></p>
              <p>She hates that the only time she has to shop is on the weekend when the stores are busier and prices are higher.
                Eating healthy just seems like <span class="highlight">so much work</span>. She grew up on processed food and doesn’t really know how to make
                vegetables taste good. She has three picky kids.</p>

                      <P> After creating a series of mind maps and word lists I settled on the name <Span class="bold">farmbox</span>.</p>
                      <P> As there is so little awareness of what a CSA is, I wanted a name that was indicative and
                        straightforward- not too abstract. Farmbox is just that. It is a short, straightforward
                        way to describe what you get with a CSA membership.</p>
                        <P> The aesthetic direction for this app was driven by the target customer archetype:  a modern, farmer's-market-loving,
                          eco-conscious, foodie.</p>
                        <P>&nbsp;</br>With the name settled and a good sense of the desired brand direction, I moved on to sketching for a logo:</p>

                        I wanted something striking and <span class="highlight">unexpected</span>, yet fresh and modern. I
                        chose a palette of deep blue, magenta and pale grey.

                      <P>Gothic A1 is used for almost all the body text, navigation and headings. Its a versatile font
                        with many weight options. Burford Rustic is used for the logo and page title. The Girl Next Door is used for landing page headings.

                           <p><span class="bold">Result:</span> Preference testing and design reviews indicated that though a lot of
                              scrolling is not ideal, users would rather <span class="highlight">scroll</span> than
                             have to click on a drop-down and then click a second time to make a selection. Also <span class="highlight">immediate
                             visibility</span> of all options seemed preferable. So, A. was the clear preference for these tests.</p>

                         <li>create an intermediary pop-up for deciding which meal the add to button leads to</li>
