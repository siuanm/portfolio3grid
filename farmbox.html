         <P><span class="bold">Community Supported Agriculture</span>, or CSA,  is a system that connects the producer and consumers within the
           food system more closely by allowing the consumer to subscribe to the harvest of a certain farm or group of farms.

<P>Farmbox is a simple-to-use mobile app that allows consumers to easily locate, evaluate and sign up for CSA options near
   to a specified location, while also encouraging retention after joining.

          <P>Not only is there very little <span class="bold">awareness</span> about CSA’s in the general population, but even for people who are aware, there are very few <span class="bold">centralized resources</span> of information about ALL the CSA options available in a particular area.
          <P>Further, there are many common frustrations that CSA users indicate are a barrier to retention, frustrations that could potentially be alleviated through the use of an app.
          <P>The main frustration reported by current and former CSA members is simply knowing what they will be receiving each week and what to do with it.

           <P>Once signed up, users can easily view subscription <span class="bold">contents</span> for a particular week.

                 <P>Surveying the landscape for competitors, it was challenging to find a true competitor. Three applications emerged that offered some similar functionalities. These applciations were CSAware, Farmigo and Harvie.
                 <BR>&nbsp;<img src="images/competitors_farmbox.png" class=img_b alt="csaware farmigo and harvie logos">
                 <P><span class="bold">Results of my analysis:</span></p>
                 <P><span class="bold">CSAware:</span> is a product for overall farm management that incorporates an app for customers as part of its package. It is a robust package that is aimed at farms rather than consumers, doesn’t offer a centralized locator for all CSA’s and might be expensive and overkill for a small farm.</p>
                 <P><span class="bold">Farmigo:</span> like CSAware, is aimed at farms rather than consumers and is a robust farm management tool. It is not for locating and comparing CSA options and is integrated with farm management software.
.</p>
                 <P><span class="bold">Harvie:</span> is also aimed at farms, but has a more streamlined interface than the other two competitors and doesn’t seem to involve a whole farm management solution. It does however only represent farms that are signed up with Harvie, rather than fully representing all options in the area.

              <p><Span class="bold">Motivations -</span>
              <p>He loves to cook, but doesn’t have a lot of free time for shopping and meal planning. He used to belong to a CSA and loved the locally sourced, fresh produce. He is very organized and likes to plan ahead.
              <p><Span class="bold">Frustrations -</span>
              <p>When he belonged to the CSA, he never knew what he was going to get and so never had the right ingredients to pair with what he got in his box. His kids could be picky eaters and he felt without proper planning much of the food went to waste.

               <p><Span class="bold">Motivations -</span>
               <p>Healthy eating and sustainable living are both a huge priority for Katelyn. Though she would like for everything she consumes to be organic, she needs to be very budget conscious in shopping for food. She would like to shop locally.
               <p><Span class="bold">Frustrations -</span>
               <p>CSA options in her area are too expensive for her budget. The shares usually involve too much food. She hates all of the plastic packaging in the supermarket.

               <p><Span class="bold">Motivations -</span>
               <p>Kristin really needs things to be convenient and quick because she doesn’t have a lot of time after work. She wants her whole family to eat healthier but finds it hard to implement.
              <p><Span class="bold">Frustrations -</span>
              <p>She hates that the only time she has to shop is on the weekend when the stores are busier and prices are higher. Eating healthy just seems like so much work. She grew up on processed food and doesn’t really know how to make vegetables taste good. She has three picky kids.

                      <P> After creating a series of mind maps and word lists I settled on the name <Span class="bold">farmbox</span>.
                      <P>  Seeing as there is so little awareness of what a CSA is, I wanted a name that was indicative and
                        straightforward- not too abstract. Farmbox is just that. It is a short, straightforward
                        way to describe what you get with a CSA membership.


                        <P> The aesthetic direction for this app was driven by the target customer archetype in a modern, farmer's market loving,
                          eco-conscious foodie.
</P>
                        <P>&nbsp;</br>With the name settled and good sense of the “feel”, I moved on to sketching for a logo:

                        Again, the basis of the design was to signify a fresh, urban take on rustic authenticity.

                        I wanted something striking and unexpected, yet fresh and modern. I
                        chose a palette of deep blue, magenta and pale grey.

                        with many weight options. Burford Rustic is used for the logo and page title. The Girl Next Door is used for landing page headings.

                                 <p>Using usabilityhub.com and slack, I conducted a series of preference tests on my early mock-ups.

                           <p><span class="bold">Result:</span> The most popular choice was A, the closest to my original mock-up.
                             Users liked the richness of the colors and the vegatable variety.

                           <P class="dotted"><span class="bold">Test #2</span>
                           <p>This question arose while testing my wireframes- would users prefer drop-downs or scrolling for the sign-up screen.?
                           <img src="images/FB_test_2.png" class=img_c alt="drop down vs scroll test">
                           <p><span class="bold">Result:</span> Preference testing and design reviews indicated that though a lot of scrolling is not ideal, users would rather scroll than
                             have to click on a drop-down and then click a second time to make a selection. Also immediate
                             visibility of all options seemed preferable. So, A. was the clear preference for these tests.

                         <li>create an intermediary pop-up for deciding which meal the add to button leads to</li>
