         <P><span class="bold">Community Supported Agriculture</span>, or CSA,  is a system that connects the producer and consumers within the
           food system more closely by allowing the consumer to subscribe to the harvest of a certain farm or group of farms.

<P>Farmbox is a simple-to-use mobile app that allows consumers to easily locate, evaluate and sign up for CSA options near
   to a specified location, while also encouraging retention after joining.

          <P>Not only is there very little <span class="bold">awareness</span> about CSA’s in the general population, but even for people who are aware, there are very few <span class="bold">centralized resources</span> of information about ALL the CSA options available in a particular area.
          <P>Further, there are many common frustrations that CSA users indicate are a barrier to retention, frustrations that could potentially be alleviated through the use of an app.
          <P>The main frustration reported by current and former CSA members is simply knowing what they will be receiving each week and what to do with it.

           <P>Once signed up, users can easily view subscription <span class="bold">contents</span> for a particular week.

                 <P>Surveying the landscape for competitors, it was challenging to find a true competitor. Three applications emerged that offered some similar functionalities. These applciations were CSAware, Farmigo and Harvie.
                 <BR>&nbsp;<img src="images/competitors_farmbox.png" class=img_b alt="csaware farmigo and harvie logos">
                 <P><span class="bold">Results of my analysis:</span></p>
                 <P><span class="bold">CSAware:</span> is a product for overall farm management that incorporates an app for customers as part of its package. It is a robust package that is aimed at farms rather than consumers, doesn’t offer a centralized locator for all CSA’s and might be expensive and overkill for a small farm.</p>
                 <P><span class="bold">Farmigo:</span> like CSAware, is aimed at farms rather than consumers and is a robust farm management tool. It is not for locating and comparing CSA options and is integrated with farm management software.
.</p>
                 <P><span class="bold">Harvie:</span> is also aimed at farms, but has a more streamlined interface than the other two competitors and doesn’t seem to involve a whole farm management solution. It does however only represent farms that are signed up with Harvie, rather than fully representing all options in the area.

              <p><Span class="bold">Motivations -</span>
              <p>He loves to cook, but doesn’t have a lot of free time for shopping and meal planning. He used to belong to a CSA and loved the locally sourced, fresh produce. He is very organized and likes to plan ahead.
              <p><Span class="bold">Frustrations -</span>
              <p>When he belonged to the CSA, he never knew what he was going to get and so never had the right ingredients to pair with what he got in his box. His kids could be picky eaters and he felt without proper planning much of the food went to waste.

               <p><Span class="bold">Motivations -</span>
               <p>Healthy eating and sustainable living are both a huge priority for Katelyn. Though she would like for everything she consumes to be organic, she needs to be very budget conscious in shopping for food. She would like to shop locally.
               <p><Span class="bold">Frustrations -</span>
               <p>CSA options in her area are too expensive for her budget. The shares usually involve too much food. She hates all of the plastic packaging in the supermarket.

               <p><Span class="bold">Motivations -</span>
               <p>Kristin really needs things to be convenient and quick because she doesn’t have a lot of time after work. She wants her whole family to eat healthier but finds it hard to implement.
              <p><Span class="bold">Frustrations -</span>
              <p>She hates that the only time she has to shop is on the weekend when the stores are busier and prices are higher. Eating healthy just seems like so much work. She grew up on processed food and doesn’t really know how to make vegetables taste good. She has three picky kids.

                      <P>After making many lists and brainstorming a number of ideas, I decided on the name “Gather.” The fact that gather was a verb rather than a noun suggested taking action.

                           <p>At the very top of the screen, which design is best for indicating the chosen filter?

                                         led to a second round of mockups. Below are just some of the implemented adjustments.

                                        <p>Originally, I was trying to offer too many options on my bottom sheet. I wanted maximum functionality. But, tests showed that users had trouble
                                        finding what they were looking for. I had too many options and I was also not leaving enough room around the different
                                         options.
                                      <p>I decided to stick strictly to the “Miller’s Law” recommendation of +/- 5 items at a time and
                                        reduce some immediate functionality, in favor of clarity. I also created a larger sheet for more “breathing room.”

                                        <p>I decided to similarly reduce the options on my desktop menu.
                                        <p>Again, it was a decision to sacrifice some immediate functionality in order to minimize
                                          cognitive overload.

                                                      <li>Putting ideas and designs out there, <span class="bold">testing early and often</span> is very beneficial for honing in on what works and what doesn’t.</li>
                                                      <li>Though aesthetic considerations matter, form must serve function. <span class="bold">Superfluous visual elements</span>, no matter how aesthetically pleasing, can become a distraction.</li>
                                                      <li>Effective design hinges on creating a delicate balance between offering sufficient information and too much information. At the beginning of my design process, I was loosely adhering to the
                                                        idea that humans have a capacity for keeping ~7 bits of information ‘in the head’ short term (this is known as <span class="bold">Miller’s Law</span>)</li>
                                                      <li>In my effort to offer more functionality up front however, I was erring on the higher side rather than the lower side of
                                                        that approximation. My user testing and feedback confirmed it was better to organize in <span class="bold">chunks of ~5 </span>
                                                        (the lower end of the formula) and sacrifice some upfront functionality.</li>
                                                      <li>Give ideas and images <span class="bold">room to breathe!</span></li>
                                                      <li>Scrolling and drilling down are not necessarily the enemy. Often it’s better to have only a <span class="bold">handful of readily
                                                         visible options</span>, essentially narrowing your focus so as to prioritize your attention and resources.</li></oL>
